    "# Survival analysis: a linear regression approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Survival analysis is a branch of statistics that analyses the expected duration of time till one or more events will happen. Originating from biomedicine, a lot of studies have focused on time till death / recovery following medical treatment. The method can also be successfully applied to all kinds of industries, to name a few: \n",
    "- predicting customer / employee churn for marketing or HR, \n",
    "- probability of default modelling for the banking and insurance industry, \n",
    "- time till failure for utility maintenance,\n",
    "- ... .\n",
    "\n",
    "What all these business questions have in common is that they want model a censored event, meaning: for some observations we did not observe the event taking place (maybe it will never take place). As a result, these business questions are mostly modelled using a classification approach: a time-window is selected and one classifies whether an event will take place during that time-window or not. \n",
    "However, this approach has some down-sides: \n",
    "- the criteria to select the time-window are _arbitrarily_, \n",
    "- information during this time-window cannot be used as it is part of the target, \n",
    "- a complete neglectance of the aspect _time_ till the event takes place. \n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, survival analysis solves the above down-sides by explicitly optimizing an objective function that takes the censoring into account. Then why is it not very well-known? \n",
    "The \n",
    "One answer may lie in the fact that survival modelling is quite recent. It took  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I provide a genuine introduction to survival analysis in Python. While I have a lot of experience in survival analysis in R, I still have some cold-water feets to implement this in Python. These notebooks can be considered a training for me as well.\n",
