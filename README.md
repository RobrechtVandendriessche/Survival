# Survival

The goal of this repository is to implement a few survival modelling techniques in IPython Notebooks. 
- basics of survival analysis including (concepts, desc. stats, statistical tests and linear models), 
- survival machine learning, 
- survival deep learning (if time permits).

Other topics such as dealing with left truncation or time-varying covariates are left our for now.
